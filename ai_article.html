  <p> For as long as humans have built things, we’ve wrestled with the implications of what we’ve built. In many cases, these philosophical and
ethical wrestlings have made for great drama—think Frankenstein, or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Often, the hypothetical scenarios we envision
come remarkably close to true, and the discoveries we’ve made in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning make clear that a
“computer with a mind of its own” is <span><del>going to take over the world</del></span> not such a fantastic thing to imagine any longer.

<p> Perhaps this is why we are so captivated by human vs. machine competitions, because the idea of being overcome by that which we’ve
