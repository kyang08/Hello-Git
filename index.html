      <h1> Hello Friends Yooo </h1>

      <ul>The following are the reasons why I love pugs

        <li> They don't need to exercise </li>
        <li>They are tiny </li>
        <li> They have smushed noses </li>
      </ul>

            The pug is the grandest creature our world has ever seen, if I say so myself. There has never been a creature as kind or resourceful as the pug.
